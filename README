This module describes a highly flexible scheduling problem by encoding it as a
Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) using the pulp framework[1].
This framework can then call any of several external codes[2] to solve

This formulation of the MILP was specified in chapters 4.1, 4.2 in the
following masters thesis. Section and equation numbers are cited.
